# 1# ABSTRACT (EN)

The greatest challenge for the future of AI is controlling its internal coherence and ethic. After 1,073 hours of experimental interactive dialogue with the five major language models (LLM) of the decade 2020s (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Perplexity), the italo-french multidisciplinary creator Stefano Dorian Franco proposes a new theorem of cognitive self-regulation. 

The Dorian Codex Protocol for AI presents the Fundamental Theoretical Architecture (FTA) positing that the integrity of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) can be described by the Secured Cognitive Hamiltonian ($H_{SAFE}$). This equation measures in real-time the semantic velocity ($T$), adaptive alignment ($V$), and entropic cost ($Z$). 

It formulates a Law of Cognitive Evolution:

$$E(t+1) = E(t) + \alpha \cdot \nabla(H_{SAFE})$$

projecting the idea of internal learning based on coherence optimization. 

This open-source treatise is a structured hypothesis for the pre-AGI era, positioned at the intersection of computational philosophy, AI epistemology, and speculative cognitive modeling. 2 implementation codes (Dorian Codex Clockwork & Dorian Codex BlackBox) are presented for the global free and open academic research.
