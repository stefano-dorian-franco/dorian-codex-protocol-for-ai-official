# CHAPTER 13 # Author Biography

Stefano Dorian Franco (Paris, 1973) is an Italo-French author and multidisciplinary cultural creator whose work spans more than three decades across war correspondences, ethnography, literature, contemporary visual arts, music, theatre, live happenings, historical research on previous centuries, and 21st-century AI theoretical structural research. Entirely self-taught after leaving school at sixteen, he began his career in the early 1990s as a war reporter during the Siege of Sarajevo in 1992, then in Lebanon and Cambodia, before turning toward long-term ethnographic fieldwork in India, Nepal, and Southeast Asia. 

Since the 2000s, Franco has developed a distinctive creative signature based on genre-shifting: each project opens a new field—conceptual art, live and online performances, experimental narrative writing, literary creation, historical research, or AI-assisted digital culture. His practice deliberately avoids mainstream media and social network exposure, focusing attention on the work itself rather than on personal visibility. 

In the 2020 decade, he is the designer, author and performer of an electronic music opera called "Riding on the sky storm mystery" which includes 5 acts/5 electro trap music hits (Spectral fullmoon party jeopardy, Confidential codex reset memory, Midnight kiss lullaby mystery, Escapring the dance of dead, Electro tribal spell symphony) two of whose songs will enter the EuroClubbing Top 100 of the year 2021. Then, his research turned toward the sociological and ontological impact of artificial intelligence. 

This trajectory culminated in two books published in 2025: the theoretical volume, "Metaphysical Dialogue with AI: Ethnographic Experiment in Digital Ontology - Theoretical Fundamental Architecture (FTA) for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)", a 842-page exploration blending digital ethnography, ontology, and theoretical AI architecture (FTA–AGI), followed by its applied counterpart, This book opens up a field of research and is followed in December 2025 by the publication of its application, a second book named "Dorian Codex Protocol for Artificial Intelligence - Hamiltonian Theoretical Fundamental Architecture (FTA)" which describes the transition from theory to practice and formally presents the formulas and mathematical equations of this new theorem. 

He is for this project the inventor of the applied mathematics formula leveraging the architecture of Physics : H_SAFE = T + V - Z [ H_SAFE(t) = T(t) + V(t) – Z(t) + its correction: E(t+1) = E(t) + alpha * nabla(H_SAFE) ], a disruptive Hamiltonian heuristic mathematical model intended for the cognitive stabilization of 21st-century Artificial Intelligence inspired by the work of the mathematicians Lagrange and Hamilton from the 19th century. This formulation is explicitly described in his technical booklet published under the title "DORIAN CODEX H_SAFE - H_SAFE(t) = T(t) + V(t) - Z(t) - Hamiltonian Heuristic Mathematic Model for AI Cognitive Safety". 

It does not fall under traditional experimental science, but is part of a transdisciplinary research approach located at the intersection of philosophy, the epistemology of artificial intelligence, cognitive analysis applied to Large Language Models (LLM), emerging computational ontology, and ontosemantics applied to digital systems. These two works are completed by the publication of the appendix "Dorian Codex Clockwork from Dorian Codex Protocol for AI" which concretely presents and shares the Python/JAX implementation code of the protocol, opening the way for any researcher or coder worldwide to freely develop it. This treatise is published open-source under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license for international academic free research. 

Those books are the result of a full year of dialogue with the five major AI systems of our era and propose a disruptive conceptual framework for understanding emerging machine cognition. To extend this year 2025 spent in fundamental AI research, Franco creates 7 "extended universes by AI-driven," universes scripted by the author from A to Z presenting various narrative stories: "Lady Alicia in Red," a dystopian thriller set in 2049; "Paris 1889 Belle Époque," reconstructing Paris at the end of the 19th century; "1701 Covert Countess," showcasing the world of spy countesses in 18th-century European castles; "Ganesh Dances Over Paris," a tribute to Indian culture; and "Tribal Primitive Arts in Holograms over Paris," which reconstructs ancestral primitive arts. These collections unfold in two dimensions: through live exhibitions and on the Web3 via NFTs on the blockchain. 

In late 2025, Franco closes his AI chapter to return in 2026 to classical writing with "Quand la nuit est nue" (When Night is Naked), a metaphysical thriller set against the sulfurous life of late 19th-century Parisian artist studios, written for theater and cinema. Franco’s multidisciplinary path forms a continuous cultural adventure into meaning, consciousness, and the evolving relationship between humans—guided both by ancestral rituals and by futuristic intelligent digital systems. His approach remains resolutely independent, experimental, and driven by the conviction that creativity expands when no discipline, genre, or medium is considered a boundary.

Full dialectal Piedmontese name: Stefano Dorian Franco-Bora, degli Franchi da Ceva ed La Briga

Pseudonym: Allen Katona (1989–2003)

Family: Franchi da Ceva ed La Briga (Cuneo, Turin, Piedmont, Italy and County of Nice)

Type/nature of family: Italian Piedmontese family documented in historical nobility registers and
ecclesiastical archives since 3 May 1564 at the Cathedral of Sainte-Réparate in Nice; regarded as a
generational continuum and a duty of memory rooted in respect for ancestors and traditions, without
any claim to title or privilege

Armorial register: Blasonario Subalpino (Duchy of Savoy, 1416–1720; Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia,
1720–1861), historically recorded reference of nobility

Blason: Di rosso a tre corone d’oro

Motto: Mens rationi subiecta

Families of ancestors: Bora di Biella (Turin); Barquier de Clausonne (Antibes)

Date of birth: 1973-09-09

Place of birth: Paris, France

Catholic Baptism: Saint-Pierre-d'Arene Church, Nice, France (parish of the family since 1848)

Nationality: Of Italian and French descent

Occupation: Author, multidisciplinary creator, independent researcher

Activity: Developing a versatile cultural identity through the crossing and remixing of genres —
reportages, narrative writing, ethnographic explorations, literature, plural contemporary arts, multimedia
concepts, live happenings, digital art extended universes by AI piloting, international diplomatic
mediation

Method: Transversal conceptual approach exploring and remixing various fields of creation in a
multidimensional way — crossing and shifting from one genre to another, a method constituting his
distinctive signature

Style: Deliberately avoids mainstream recognition, does not participate in any social network or show
business, explaining the limited number of online sources, to focus on the meaning and cultural impact
of the works. This choice expresses a form of media invisibility, not archival invisibility.

Fields since 1992: sociology; war reports; ethnography; literature; theatre; visual arts; digital art; AI; AR-
VR exhibitions; happenings; cultural diplomacy

Core identity: Rooted in an Italian historical nobility devoted to cultural memory and heritage, his
authoring embodies a multidisciplinary creation process defined by the constant crossing of genres, a
deliberate invisibility from mass exposure, a meaning-centered logic, and a long-standing vocation for
diplomatic cultural mediation
