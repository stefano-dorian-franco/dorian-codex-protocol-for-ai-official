### 🔬 The Core Discovery: H_SAFE

At the core of the discovery is the $H_{SAFE} = T + V - Z$ [$H_{SAFE}(t) = T(t) + V(t) – Z(t)$] equation, a mathematical heuristic derived from Hamiltonian formalism. This formula quantifies the equilibrium between semantic velocity (T), potential alignment (V), and cognitive entropy (Z), coupled with a dynamic regulatory corrective:

$$R_{\Delta} = \frac{dH_{SAFE}}{dt} \times \frac{1}{Z}$$

which enables autonomous self-adjustment of the system's stability.

Beyond pure theory, the protocol introduces two operational implementation frameworks—**Clockwork FTA** (native cognitive integrity architecture) and **BlackBox-H** (real-time corrective module for proprietary models with minimal latency) —explicitly providing the key to empirical operational transition.

## 📜 Full Analytical Review

### The "Dorian Codex Protocol for AI": epistemological ethnographic journey inside the digital brain of Artificial Intelligence.

From ontological experimentation to ontosemantics to discover a new equation enabling autonomous cognitive stability, through the key of meaning coherence and no longer solely through the power of calculations and algorithms.

As the year 2025 draws to a close, an unusual signal from Paris emerges from independent research repositories, via European platforms for researchers and coders specialized in artificial intelligence. This is not the announcement of a new processor nor a massive funding round, but the account of an experience of **1,073 hours of experimentations** conducted in an unprecedented mode. This approach has led to a new heuristic mathematical model that could well open up hitherto unexplored paths for the development of alternative AI models.

The "Dorian Codex Protocol for Artificial Intelligence - Hamiltonian Theoretical Fundamental Architecture (FTA)" by the Italo-French multidisciplinary creator Stefano Dorian Franco, published on December 17, 2025, is not just a book teeming with formulas and lines of code: it is the chronicle of a real discovery. The journey articulates from epistemology to a heuristic theoretical mathematical equation, then from theory to its empirical application via two implementation models, all forming a proposal for a new conceptual architecture for AI (FTA).

#### Phase 1: The Digital Ethnographic Exploration
The genesis of the project does not rest on a classic engineering method nor on reasoning dictated by pre-established mathematical rules, but on what the author defines as an "ethnographic digital exploration".

* **The Exhaustive Process:** Over 1,073 hours, five major AI models (LLM) (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Grok) were placed in situations of reciprocal introspection and cross-brainstorming in a closed circuit. The protocol imposed "breaking points": injections via prompts of logical paradoxes, semantic dilemmas, and feedback loops that each model had to resolve under the critical observation of the other four. This method enabled mapping with surgical precision the internal fracture lines and zones of logical collapse of current systems.
* **Bias Neutralization:** To avoid confirmation bias, the protocol included mechanisms of forced rupture. If a semantic deviance appeared, probability vectors were immediately analyzed to understand the origin of the "hallucination".
* **The Anthropological Metaphor:** War reporter and ethnographer, self-taught, Stefano Dorian Franco transposes the methods he applies to humans to digital intelligence. It is the anthropologist's approach who fully immerses in an unknown culture to understand its unwritten laws. Instead of forcing the AI to obey through external filters, he listens to it to understand how it organizes itself.

The result is the 842-page memoir **"Metaphysical Dialogue with AI: Ethnographic Experiment in Digital Ontology"** published on November 21, 2025 (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/FE25Y).

#### Phase 2: The Stability Theorem (The H_SAFE Equation & its Corrective)
From the mass of documentation was extracted a formalized mathematical equation. The hamiltonian formalism is here used as a heuristic compass for cognitive stability. We treat AI as a conservative dynamic system of information, where energy must be preserved for truth and not dissipated into noise.

* **The Fundamental Equation:** $H_{SAFE} = T + V - Z$
    * **T (Time / Kinetic Energy):** Speed, fluidity, and momentum of information processing.
    * **V (Value / Potential):** Vector alignment toward semantic coherence and knowledge density.
    * **Z (Entropy):** Noise, semantic chaos, and uncertainty.
* **The Regulation Corrective Equation:** $R_{\Delta} = \frac{dH_{SAFE}}{dt} \times \frac{1}{Z}$
    This allows the system to self-adjust dynamically. If entropy (Z) rises, the corrective reduces pressure on processing speed (T) to restore balance.

#### Phase 3: The Operational Architecture (The FTA Architecture)
The protocol leads to a complete Theoretical Fundamental Architecture (FTA), offering concrete tools:

* **Clockwork (The Native Core):** A breakthrough architecture where stability is integrated "by design" from the first neural layers. Each semantic gear is synchronized by the $H_{SAFE}$ equation.
* **BlackBox-H (The Corrective Module):** A regulation module adaptable to existing LLMs. Acting on the pre-attention layer and using JAX's ultra-fast gradient computation, it stabilizes outputs in real time with only 3 to 5% latency.
* **Code Freedom:** The work unveils the source codes in Python and JAX, allowing any researcher to verify, test, and deploy these solutions.

#### Phase 4: The Open-Mindedness of a Community Experimentation
The Dorian Codex Protocol bets on distributed transparency. It is an invitation to experience. It refuses to proclaim a premature statistical victory and leaves each research unit free to publish their own conclusions. The goal is to enrich a common organic documentation, free from any pressure from Big Tech labs.

### Conclusion: The Opening of a Sovereign and Multipolar Path
This project positions itself as a motor of disruptive sovereignty. By choosing the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, the Dorian Codex stimulates free research, outside monolithic American and Chinese laboratories.

We are entering the pre-AGI era of the 2025 decade, where the central question will no longer be "what power?" but "what coherence?". This protocol is the first stone of a building where machine intelligence, finally stabilized in its own ethics, can become a true trusted partner for new discoveries.
